# Movie Trailer Website

This is the first project of the **Fullstack Web Developer Nanodegree Program** from [Udacity](https://udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004).

## Files

  * entertainment_center.py
  * fresh_tomatoes.py
  * fresh_tomatoes.hml
  * media.py

#### entertainment_center.py
This file is responsible for define a function that queries an online [Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/) for movie info, once it has the information needed, it instances movie objects using media.py and pass that information to fresh_tomatoes.py to render a HTML page fresh_tomatoes.html.

#### fresh_tomatoes.py
Responsible for receiving the movies and render a HTML file fresh_tomatoes.hml.

#### fresh_tomatoes.html
A HTML file generated by fresh_tomatoes.py wich contains information about the movies. It shows each movie cover, it's name, once you hover the mouse over the cover it displays the storyline of that movie, click on it and you can watch the movie's trailer.

#### media.py
A Python file that specifies the class movie used to instance movie objects.

## Instructions

First access the Movie Database API [website](https://www.themoviedb.org/), sign up to get an API Key that will be used, insert it into entertainment_center.py in line 10 so it will look similar to this:

`api_key = 'a1b52004c9de03e30f1g1d240c45d57c'`

If you are behind a proxy, to access the API insert your configuration in line 8 of entertainment_center.py to look similar this:

`proxies = dict(http='http://127.0.0.1:1080')`

Now all you have to do is create variables, call the function `create_movie()` passing as argument the movie name, it will return a movie object, you can group them all together in a list like `movies[]` and pass it as argument to `fresh_tomatoes.open_movies_page()` wich will render fresh_tomatoes.html, open it on your favorite browser and have fun!

**Here is my list example:**
```
the_matrix = create_movie("The Matrix")
toy_story = create_movie("Toy Story")
the_godfather = create_movie("The Godfather")
top_gun = create_movie("Top Gun")
back_to_the_future = create_movie("Back to the Future")
lord_of_the_rings = create_movie("Lord of the Rings")
alien = create_movie("Alien")
rocky_iv = create_movie("Rocky IV")
predator = create_movie("Predator")
movies = [the_matrix, toy_story, the_godfather,
          top_gun, back_to_the_future,
          lord_of_the_rings, alien, rocky_iv, predator]
fresh_tomatoes.open_movies_page(movies)
```
